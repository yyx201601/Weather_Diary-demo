# Weather & Diary Web App

[toc]



## üìå **1. Project description**
Our Weather & Diary Web Application is a personal journaling platform designed to support emotional reflection and daily self-expression. Users can log in, write private diary entries, and track their moods over time in a simple and calming interface. The goal is to create a safe digital space where users can unload their thoughts, monitor emotional patterns, and gradually build a habit of self-awareness.

While initially developed with weather-based reminders and scheduling tools, the project evolved through team discussions to focus more intentionally on emotional well-being. The current version emphasizes free-form diary writing, mood logging, and gentle prompts that encourage users to engage in consistent self-reflection.

This application is especially suited for students and professionals seeking a lightweight and private way to maintain mental clarity amid their busy routines. It combines personal expression with minimalist design, offering users a peaceful corner of the internet to check in with themselves‚Äîone entry at a time.

# ‚ùì4. Known bugs / limitations

- **Diary Tag Handling**: 

  Tag input currently accepts strings instead of structured arrays. Although tags are saved successfully, improper formats (non-array types) may not trigger console warnings. 

  Additionally, attempting to save a diary without any tags causes an error, even though the entry still gets saved.

- **Mobile Responsiveness**: 

  The UI layout is optimized for desktop and may not render well on mobile or tablet devices.

- **No User Avatar Upload**

  Although the user profile page is functional, there is currently no option for users to upload or update a profile picture. This limits personal identity and visual customization.

- **Timezone Inconsistencies**

  All diary entries are timestamped based on the server's time zone. Users in different time zones may find that entry dates and times do not accurately reflect their local time.

# üöÄ 5. Future Improvements

- **Public Entry Sharing**: 
  Currently, diary entries can be marked as ‚Äúpublic‚Äù or ‚Äúprivate,‚Äù but there is no sharing mechanism in place. A future update should include a sharing feature (e.g., public link or QR code) to give ‚Äúpublic‚Äù entries meaningful functionality.

- **Better Tag Input Validation**: 
  Improve the front-end and back-end tag input handling to enforce array formats, and provide clearer feedback for incorrect or empty inputs.

- **Mobile Optimization**: 
  Introduce responsive layout adjustments for smaller screens and touch interactions to improve mobile usability.

- **Rich Text Editing for Diary**

  Upgrade the diary input field to support rich text formatting‚Äîsuch as bold, italic, bullet points, and embedded media‚Äîto improve the writing experience and enable expressive journaling.

- **Diary Export / Backup**

  Allow users to export their diary entries in formats such as PDF, Markdown, or JSON. This feature can also support scheduled email backups or cloud syncing for long-term data retention.

- **Social Features**

  Introduce lightweight social interaction by enabling users to follow public diaries, like or comment on posts, and optionally share entries on a timeline feed. These features can increase engagement and community-building.
